  I just watched the first section about styling the header of this project. So far I have lerned how to use the polygon attribute to style the shape of an element using CSS. Everything else I pretty much knew already. I am excited to use this technique to make my headers look 'modern' is some future projects. I also learned about a cool extension that will hilight colors in the editor with the color of the color.

  I completed writing the code for the first section of the header. After I complete the entire header I will switch into my own project where I implement the knowledge from this course.

  [4:53pm]
  Finished watching the next section about styling and positioning the text in the header. I usualy use flexbox to position things in the center, but here I learned more in depth about how to use position absolute and transform to center things. Good to know.

  I styled the header text content. I used rem units instead of pixels like the video shows because I like my fonts to be responsive. I'm sure hell suggest the same later in the course anyways.
