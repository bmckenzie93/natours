  I just watched the first section about styling the header of this project. So far I have lerned how to use the polygon attribute to style the shape of an element using CSS. Everything else I pretty much knew already. I am excited to use this technique to make my headers look 'modern' is some future projects. I also learned about a cool extension that will hilight colors in the editor with the color of the color. 

  [4:34pm]
  I completed writing the code for the first section of the header. After I complete the entire header I will switch into my own project where I implement the knowledge from this course.

  [4:53pm]
  Finished watching the next section about styling and positioning the text in the header. I usualy use flexbox to position things in the center, but here I learned more in depth about how to use position absolute and transform to center things. Good to know.

  I styled the header text content. I used rem units instead of pixels like the video shows because I like my fonts to be responsive. I'm sure hell suggest the same later in the course anyways.

  I just coded in the animation for the heading text to slide in from the left/right on load. It is something that I dont use often so I want to remember how to do this in the future.

  Watched the lecture on styling the button to look as if it is raising off the page when hovered on, and gets closer to the page when it is being clicked. Super cool, this is definately one of the key things I want to have going on in my style of web designing using css.

  Completed the hober and active states for the button on the heading. I love the functionality of using translate with box shadow to make the button look as though we are actually pressing on it in 3d.
